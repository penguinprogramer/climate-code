# Greeneye
This project allows users to look up a company either by name or by scanning the barcode of a project and get the sustainable related info about the project. We also support plugins to use the BE PAIs to display data.

##What it does

Put simply my solution is a text and image based search engine which shows the environmental credentials of both companies and products.

Users can either enter a company name or scan a product barcode to get the details of either the product or company
